# 🦴 Predicting Osteoporosis Risk

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is at **Risk** or **Not at Risk** of developing osteoporosis based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors.

## 📊 Project Objective:
To build a classification model that helps predict the risk of osteoporosis in individuals, aiding in early detection and personalized care.

## 🔍 Key Highlights:
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values using mode and imputation techniques for categorical features.
- Feature Engineering: Applied encoding techniques and assessed feature importance.
- Model Building: Used Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost for classification.
- Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## 🎯 Target Column:
`Osteoporosis`  
- 0 = No  
- 1 = Yes

## 📈 Outcome:
Achieved significant improvement in model performance after data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed promising results.
